### Windows - everything you need:

You can install the prerequisites any way you want, but I recommend using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/).

You'll need a tool called `git` which manages software versions.
Open a command prompt and enter `choco install git`  
I don't use Windows, I think you might have to use an Administrator command prompt.

You'll need a code editor. I suggest Visual Studio Code:  
`choco install vscode`

This project is built with a Javascript tool called Node. You need Node Package Manager, aka npm:  
`choco install npm`

To download this source code, in a command prompt in the folder you want to use, run  
`git clone "https://github.com/seigler/bl3skills.com.git"`

Install the Node dependencies with `npm install`  

Start the project with `npm run watch`

Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code and make whatever changes you want. The project should update along with your changes.
